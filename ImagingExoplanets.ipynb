    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, stellar PSF subtraction distorts and attenuates any astrophysical signals such as planets in the image. This is due to two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Over-subtraction: when we scale the intensity of any model image of the stellar diffraction to match the science image, so we can subtract off the flux, the scale factor will be biased if an additional astrophysical signal exists in the data. It will cause the scale factor to be overestimated, which causes some planet flux to be subtracted off. This applies to ADI, SDI, and RDI.\n",
    " * Self-subtraction: when we built a model of the stellar diffraction using images with astrophysical sources in it, those sources will leak into the model. Scaling the model with remnants of additional astrophysical signal in it will cause the artifacts in the image (see the negative lobes on either side of the planet azimuthally in the images above). This applies to ADI and SDI, but not RDI. Note that this effect is typically more severe than the over-subtraction effect.\n",
    " \n",
    "To correct for these biases, we inject planets with known fluxes and positions into the data. To characterize the flux and position of a planet, we want to inject simulated planets at many other azimuthal positions, but the same radial distance from the star. We re-run PSF subtraction with the data augmented with simualted planets, measure the properties of the planets, and compare against the inejcted values to determine the biases. This makes the assumption the noise is azimuthally symmetric around the star (which is usually a decent assumption). Below, we will inject two fake planets into one dataset. For publications, we generally inject many more (multiple reductions where each time we place a simulated planet at a different resolution element).\n",

    "\n",
    "For Keck, we can take a frame of the star using a much shorter exposure time, so it doesn't saturate the detector. We can scale the flux of the star by the exposure times to match what the flux of the star would be in each science frame if detectors don't saturate. Then, we can scale down the flux to simualte a planet, and inject it into a position around the star.\n"
