Scaling the model with remnants of additional astrophysical signal in it will cause the artifacts in the image (see the negative lobes on either side of the planet azimuthally in the images above). This applies to ADI and SDI, but not RDI. Note that this effect is typically more severe than the over-subtraction effect.\n","\n","To correct for these biases, we inject planets with known fluxes and positions into the data. To characterize the flux and position of a planet, we want to inject simulated planets at many other azimuthal positions, but the same radial distance from the star. We re-run PSF subtraction with the data augmented with simualted planets, measure the properties of the planets, and compare against the inejcted values to determine the biases. This makes the assumption the noise is azimuthally symmetric around the star (which is usually a decent assumption). Below, we will inject two fake planets into one dataset. For publications, we generally inject many more (multiple reductions where each time we place a simulated planet at a different resolution element).\n","\n","## Inject fake planets into the data\n","\n","Each high contrast instrument should have a way to obtain an measurement of the star without the coronagraph.

In our field, we nominally use a \"5-sigma\" threshold for quantifying sesntivity. It means we claim we are not sensitive to any planets that are less than 5 standard deviations brighter than the noise. This is a rough approximation of our sensitivity when we do planet detection by eye, but it is an approximation.\n","\n","Note: There are more accurate and procedural versions that we will not go into here (perhaps a good project?). The systematic way to determine sensitivity is to have a planet detection algorithm (e.g., the cross correlation maps we derived above), determine a detection threshold for your algorithm based on how many candidates your imaging program can follow up (this could be above or below 5-sigma), follow-up to confirm/reject candidates, and publish your sensitivity curves using your detection threshold.\n","\n","## Generate a 1-D contrast curve\n","\n","We will use the code below to generate a contrast curve. It is a 1-D curve because it assumes the noise is azimuthally symmetric. We need to specify the resolution of our data (the FWHM of a PSF), because we need to correct for small number statistics (see https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/792/2/97). This accounts for the fact that our estimate of the standard deviation of the noise is uncertain because of our limited number of independent samples of the noise. We also smooth the image (low pass filter) slightly to average out pixel-to-pixel noise due to things like detector noise. This is something we do by eye anyways, so we are reflecting that.\n","\n","The contrast curve assumes there are no planets in the data (we are just measuring noise). But there are planets in the data! This will bias the contrast curve, creating bumps you see below. Project: mask out these planets to better measure contrast.\n","\n","The contrast curve we derive is also attenuated by oversubtraction and selfsubtraction so we need to correct for algorithm throughput just like flux. We do that and convert from counts to flux ratio."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c1e5bf8d","metadata":{"id":"c1e5bf8d"},"outputs":[],"source":["dataset_fwhm = fwhm\n","low_pass_size = 1\n","contrast_seps, uncalib_contrast_dn = pyklip.klip.meas_contrast(output_img, dataset.IWA, dataset.OWA,\n","                                             dataset_fwhm, center=dataset.output_centers[0],\n","                                             low_pass_filter=low_pass_size)\n","\n","calib_contrat_fluxratio = (uncalib_contrast_dn/exptime) / algo_throughput / (peakflux_star/calib_exptime)\n","\n","plt.figure()\n","plt.plot(contrast_seps, calib_contrat_fluxratio, 'b-')\n","plt.ylabel(\"5-sigma contrast\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"Separation (arcsec)\")\n","plt.yscale(\"log\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"484a7ed9","metadata":{"id":"484a7ed9"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.1"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
